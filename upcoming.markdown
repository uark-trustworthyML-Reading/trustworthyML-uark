**Abstract:** As AI and ML become more pervasive in our lives, it is important to ensure that the models being deployed treat individuals similarly regardless of their demographics. Statistical fairness measures have long reigned as the popular choice for integrating fairness into an ML pipeline. However, causal fairness criteria are quickly stepping into the limelight for their ability to go beyond mere correlation offered by statistical fairness measures. In this talk, I will discuss the ins and outs of causal inference and causal fairness from a sociotechnical lens. Specifically, in addition to explaining the basics of causal inference and causal fairness, I will demonstrate why causal fairness is needed in addition to standard statistical fairness measures, describe the connection of causal fairness to U.S. discrimination and criminal law, as well as present several of the sociological criticisms of causal fairness.
