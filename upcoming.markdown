<!--**Abstract:** -->
<!--Since the launch of applications such as dallâ€¢e, Midjourney, and-->
<!--Stable Diffusion, generative artificial intelligence has been controversial as a tool for creating artwork. Some writers have presented-->
<!--worries about these technologies as harbingers of fully automated-->
<!--futures to come, but more pressing is the impact of generative AI-->
<!--on creative labour in the present. Already, business leaders have-->
<!--begun replacing human artistic labour with AI-generated images. In-->
<!--response, the artistic community has launched a protest movement,-->
<!--which argues that AI image generation is a kind of theft. This paper-->
<!--analyzes, substantiates, and critiques these arguments, concluding-->
<!--that AI image generators involve an unethical kind of labour theft.-->
<!--If correct, many other AI applications also rely upon theft.-->
