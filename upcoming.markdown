- **Abstract:** The last 3 years have resulted in machine learning (ML)-based
image generators with the ability to output consistently higher
quality images based on natural language prompts as inputs. As
a result, many popular commercial “generative AI Art” products
have entered the market, making generative AI an estimated $48B
industry [125]. However, many professional artists have spoken
up about the harms they have experienced due to the proliferation
of large scale image generators trained on image/text pairs from
the Internet. In this paper, we review some of these harms which
include reputational damage, economic loss, plagiarism and copyright infringement. To guard against these issues while reaping the
potential benefits of image generators, we provide recommendations such as regulation that forces organizations to disclose their
training data, and tools that help artists prevent using their content
as training data without their consent.
