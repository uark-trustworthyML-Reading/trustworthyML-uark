<!--  - [AI Art and its Impact on Artists](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3600211.3604681)-->

<!--- **Abstract:** The last 3 years have resulted in machine learning (ML)-based-->
<!--image generators with the ability to output consistently higher-->
<!--quality images based on natural language prompts as inputs. As-->
<!--a result, many popular commercial “generative AI Art” products-->
<!--have entered the market, making generative AI an estimated $48B-->
<!--industry [125]. However, many professional artists have spoken-->
<!--up about the harms they have experienced due to the proliferation-->
<!--of large scale image generators trained on image/text pairs from-->
<!--the Internet. In this paper, we review some of these harms which-->
<!--include reputational damage, economic loss, plagiarism and copyright infringement. To guard against these issues while reaping the-->
<!--potential benefits of image generators, we provide recommendations such as regulation that forces organizations to disclose their-->
<!--training data, and tools that help artists prevent using their content-->
<!--as training data without their consent.-->
